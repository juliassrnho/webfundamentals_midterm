	</figure>


	<p>The New School's campus is composed of many buildings, most of which are minutes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Square,_Manhattan" target="_blank">Union Square</a>.</p>

	<p>The university's Parsons division also has affiliations with schools that operate independently but embrace Parsons' philosophy and teaching methodology, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsons_Paris_(2013)" target="_blank">Parsons Paris</a> (France), India School of Design and Innovation (Mumbai, India), and La Escuela de Diseño at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altos_de_Chav%C3%B3n" target="_blank">Altos de Chavón</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Romana,_Dominican_Republic" target="_blank">La Romana, Dominican Republic</a>.</p>

	<h3>University Center</h3>
		
		<i>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Center_(The_New_School)" target="_blank">University Center (The New School)</a></i>
	
	<p>The New School opened the 16-story <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Center_(The_New_School)" target="_blank">University Center</a> ("UC") at 65 5th Avenue in January 2014.[30][31]</p>

	<p>While the 65 Fifth Avenue plans were initially controversial among students and Village residents (spurring in 2009 a major student occupation was held at The New School's previous building on that site), plans for the University Center were adjusted in response to community concerns and have since been well received. In a review of the University Center's final design, <i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" target="_blank">The New York Times</a></i> architecture critic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolai_Ouroussoff" target="_blank">Nicolai Ouroussoff</a> called the building "a celebration of the cosmopolitan city".</p>

	</figure>
	<p>The UC serves as a central hub for all university students. The tower, which was designed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skidmore,_Owings_%26_Merrill" target="_blank">Skidmore, Owings and Merrill</a>'s Roger Duffy, is the biggest capital project the university has ever undertaken. The building, added classrooms, new residences, computer labs, event facilities, and a cafeteria to the downtown New York City campus in addition to a library, and lecture hall.[32][33]</p>

	<h3>Historical significance</h3>

	<p>Several of the university buildings are certified by New York City as historical landmarks. Prominent among these is the egg-shaped Tishman Auditorium, considered by many to be the first building to employ modern architecture. It was designed by architect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Urban" target="_blank">Joseph Urban</a>, along with the entirety of The New School's historic 66 West 12th Street building. Thousands of writer's forums, author visits, political debates, award ceremonies, academic lectures, performances, and public hearings are held for both the academic community and general public throughout the year in Tishman.</p>

	<p>Newer buildings have garnered a multitude of awards. Among these is The Sheila Johnson Design Center, which attracted media attention for its revolutionary design. In 2009, it won the SCUP's Excellence in Architecture Renovation/Adaptive Reuse Award.[34] In addition to being a Parsons core academic building, the Center also serves as a public art gallery.[35] The New School Welcome Center, located on 13th Street and Fifth Avenue, won the American Institute of Architects, New York Chapter's Interiors Merit Award in 2010.[36]</p>

	<h3>Residence halls</h3>

The university operates five residence halls:

<ul> 
<li> <b>13th Street Residence Hall:</b> A facility primarily serving first-year students, 13th Street Residence is popular for its close proximity to academic buildings and location just seconds away from the university's flagship library, Fogelman.[37] </li>
<li> <b>Loeb Hall:</b> Loeb Hall is a co-ed residence hall located on 12th Street in the East Village. After the relocation of Student Health Services (which was once housed in Loeb), the lobby has been renovated.[38]</li>

<li> <b>20th Street Residence Hall:</b> Located in Chelsea, 20th Street Residence offers some of the university's largest suites and houses mostly returning students and graduate students.</li> </ul>

<b>Former residence halls:</b>

<ul> <li><b>William Street Residence:</b> Located in Lower Manhattan near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Street_Seaport" target="_blank">South Street Seaport</a>.

List Foundation. The collection, now grown to approximately 1,800 postwar and contemporary works of art, includes examples in almost all media. Parts of it are exhibited throughout the campus. Notable artists such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol" target="_blank">Andy Warhol</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara_Walker" target="_blank">Kara Walker</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Serra" target="_blank">Richard Serra</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt" target="_blank">Sol LeWitt</a> all have pieces displayed in New School's academic buildings.[44]</p>

		<h3> Student government</h3>

<p>There are several student government and leadership councils at The New School. Among them are:

<ul> <li> University Student Senate (USS) </li></ul>
The University Student Senate is composed of students from every division. Its composition is Parsons - 5, Lang - 3, New School for Public Engagement - 3, New School for Social Research - 2, Jazz - 1, and Mannes - 1. The USS acts as the connection between students and administration, serving the needs and concerns of the students. The duties of the USS include giving a political statement regarding macro issues within the school (gender neutral bathrooms, divestment, etc.), as well as micro issues. Additionally, the USS provide a cap of $5,000 funding for initiatives that serves the entire New School.</p>
<ul>
<li> Lang Student Union (LSU)</li>
<li>Parsons Student Senate (PSS)</li>
<li>Executive Director's Student Advisory Council (at the School of Jazz)</li>
<li>Residence Hall Councils</li> 
</ul>

		<h3>Student organizations</h3>

		<p> The New School houses over 50 recognized student organizations, most of which are geared towards artistic endeavors or civic engagement.[45] Notable among these are The Theatre Collective, which stages numerous dramatic productions throughout the year, Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), Debate Team, ReNew School (sustainability and environmental advocacy group) Moxie (feminist alliance), the New Urban Grilling Society (NUGS), and The Radical Student Union (RSU).</p>

		<h3>Student-run media</h3>
	<h4>Print</h4>
	<p>A noted student newspaper, <i>The New School Free Press</i>, also known as <i>NSFP</i> is widely distributed throughout the campus. Hard print copies are available in most academic buildings, while an online edition is available as well.[46] Students at Eugene Lang College publishes <i>Release</i>, a student-run literary magazine.</p>

	<h4>WNSR radio</h4>
	<p>WNSR, a student-run, faculty-advised online-only radio station, also operates at the university. Programming is currently delivered in the form of streamable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3" target="_blank">mp3s</a> and, in the near future, subscribable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast" target="_blank">podcasts</a>. It is a station for all divisions of The New School.[47]</p>

	<h3>Athletics and recreation</h3>
	<p>Current Athletics and Recreation Director Diane Yee joined The New School in August 2012. On October 25, 2012 a school-wide election was held to select a mascot, where The New School Narwhals were born. On January 25, 2013 the athletics logo was launched, designed by Parsons’ student Matthew Wolff (Graphic Design '14).[48]</p>

	<p>The department began in December 2008 under its original name Recreation and Intramural sports. The initial director, Michael McQuarrie, held the position for four years. He built a relationship with the McBurney YMCA where intramurals continue to be held on Wednesday nights and created the ongoing New School Olympics and charitable 5K Turkey Trot.</p>

	<p>The Narwhals feature several intercollegiate teams: basketball (2009), cross country (2010), cycling (2013), soccer (2013), tennis (2014), ultimate Frisbee (2014). The New School Narwhals are an independent school, unaffiliated with the NCAA, but regularly compete against NCAA Division III schools.</p>

	<p><b>Basketball</b> – competes regularly against Cooper Union, Culinary Institute of America, Pratt Institute, and Vaughn College</p>

	<p><b>Cross Country</b> – competes in CUNYAC and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Valley_Intercollegiate_Athletic_Conference" target="_blank">HVIAC</a> conference invitationals as an unaffiliated school</p>

	<p><b>Cycling</b> – a member of the Eastern Collegiate Cycling Conference</p>

	<p><b>Soccer </b>– competes against Cooper Union, Culinary Institute of America, St. Joseph’s College, and Vaughn College</p>

	<p>In addition to sports, the recreation department offers a myriad of free fitness classes to its community including boxing, dance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training" target="_blank">HIIT</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilates" target="_blank">Pilates</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_chi" target="_blank">tai chi</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga" target="_blank">yoga</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zumba" target="_blank">Zumba</a>. Personal training is also offered at an affordable rate ranging from $16.50 to $40 per session.</p>

	<p>Outdoor Adventure trips are offered several times/week and what started to be wilderness in nature (camping, hiking, rafting) has expanded to include excursions such as archery, biking, horseback riding, skiing/snowboarding, surfing, rock climbing and trapeze.</p>

	<p>Yee has increased programming to include a second charitable race that takes place annually in April called the 5K Rabbit Run. She has also started the Urban Hunt (a scavenger hunt around campus and the Village) and Club New (a dance party for first-year students the weekend before first day of classes). </p>

	<h3>Traditions</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Each August, community residents, the university, and local businesses stop traffic on the 12th street block for one afternoon. A massive block party is then thrown, celebrating the return of New School students to Greenwich Village. Another block party is held in the spring, usually during one of the first warm weeks of the semester.</li>
	<li>The Fusion Fashion Show is one of The New School's, and New York City's, biggest industry events. Each year, first and second-year undergraduates from Parsons compete directly with the fashion program's fiercest rival— <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_Institute_of_Technology" target="_blank">Fashion Institute of Technology</a> (FIT)—in the show, vying for awards and the title of best overall school.</li>
	<li>The New School annually hosts the Parsons Fashion Benefit, which is consistently attended by celebrities and industry moguls. It showcases the work of the current graduating class and raises money to fund scholarships for the fashion design program.[49] </li>
	<li>Every April, the university celebrates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-Day_(movement)" target="_blank">V-Day </a> for two weeks.[50] Originally started by the student feminist organization Moxie (which has since disbanded), "V-Day at The New School" has been adopted by the community and become a major part of campus life. In conjunction with V-Day, the university also recognizes each April as Sexual Assault and Prevention Awareness Month. During this time, T-shirts painted with feminist art and statements against sexual and domestic violence are hung on a clothesline in the windows of every major academic building. This is done as part of the Clothesline Project, and seeks to engage the public with New School's activist community.[51]</li>
	<li>New School's annual Take Back the Night March is also held during April. In this event, students lead the university community through the streets of Greenwich Village in a public demonstration against sexual violence.[51]</li>
